ccLab Arduino Project: Color Box
=================
Here is my Arduino Project. I made a "Color Box" - a box that displays squares of color when the user pushes numbers on the keypad. Each number is associated with a color and the user can push any button and see a rainbow! It is a fun project that is meant to show my understanding of Arduino, inputs, and outputs. 

**Main Components:
**

-Arduino Uno

-TFT 1.8" 

-4x3 Pin Key Pad

-iPhone Box to conceal wires

**Libraries used:
**

Adafruit_GFX.h

Adafruit_ST7735.h

SPI.h
