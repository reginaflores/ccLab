ccLab Arduino Project
=================
Here is my Arduino Project. I made a Color Box. The Color Box displays color when the user pushes numbers on the keypad. It is a fun project that is meant to show my understanding of Arduino, inputs, and outputs. 

Main Components:

-Arduino Uno

-TFT 1.8" 

-4x3 Pin Key Pad

-iPhone Box to conceal wires
